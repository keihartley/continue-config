# 🚀 Add Comprehensive GitHub Actions Workflows

## 📋 Overview
This PR adds a complete suite of GitHub Actions workflows for build automation, release management, and tag operations.

## ✨ New Workflows Added

### 🚀 Release Workflow (`release.yml`)
- **Manual trigger** with release type selection (major/minor/patch)
- **Automatic version bumping** in package.json and config.yaml
- **Git tag creation** and pushing
- **GitHub release creation** with auto-generated notes
- **Build artifact packaging** and upload
- **Pre-release support** for beta/alpha releases

### 🏷️ Tag Management (`tag-management.yml`)
- **Create tags** with semantic version validation
- **Delete tags** with force protection
- **List tags** with analysis and statistics
- **Semantic versioning compliance** checking

## 🔧 Usage

### Creating a Release
1. Go to Actions → 🚀 Build & Release
2. Click "Run workflow"
3. Select release type (major/minor/patch)
4. Optionally mark as pre-release
5. Add custom release notes if desired

### Managing Tags
1. Go to Actions → 🏷️ Tag Management  
2. Choose action (create/delete/list)
3. For create: enter tag name (e.g., v1.2.3)
4. For delete: enable force option for safety

## ✅ Features

- **Version Management**: Automatic semantic versioning
- **Quality Gates**: All releases go through validation pipeline
- **Artifact Management**: Build outputs packaged and available
- **Release Notes**: Auto-generated from commit history
- **Safety Features**: Force flags for destructive operations
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed step summaries

## 🔒 Security & Permissions

All workflows use minimal required permissions:
- `contents: write` for releases and tags
- `packages: write` for artifact uploads
- Standard `GITHUB_TOKEN` (no additional secrets needed)

## 🧪 Testing

All workflows have been validated for:
- ✅ YAML syntax correctness
- ✅ GitHub Actions compatibility
- ✅ Proper permission scoping
- ✅ Error handling and safety checks

## 📚 Documentation

Each workflow includes:
- Comprehensive inline comments
- Clear step descriptions with emojis
- Detailed summary outputs
- Error handling with helpful messages

This provides a complete CI/CD solution for the Continue.dev configuration project.
